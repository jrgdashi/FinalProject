# FinalProject
Final


The final project it's gonna use the same data from the second project, the differencce is instead of looking at eveything I'm gonna look at the most recent games, basically when being a gamer became a viable option, work with the categorical data that I didn't use in project 2, and clean up the data.
What I wanna see it's if the genra of the game metter and what effects the popularity of the game, and the money in it. Just have somewhat of a basic understanding 
on where the most money is in the e-sport industry.

The data it's in the new.txt file
