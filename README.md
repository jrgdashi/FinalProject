# FinalProject
Final


For the final project I will be analizing the data from "The Estonia Disaster". The estonia disaster it's similar to the Titanic but with different survivors.
I have become familria with everything that happend before the incident therefore I know what the survivor charts should look like based on that information.
The data that I have aviable it's only the names of the people and the age and sex. I'll be looking at every single person but I will eleminate the names only, 
where as the nationality I do believe it might matter too.
