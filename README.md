# FinalProject
Final

My motivation for this analysis it's to find out what type of people were able to survive "The Estonia Disaster". I was watching random videos on youtube 
and this popped up, and I was able to find a data set for in on Kaggle.
I'll be soursing my data from [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christianlillelund/passenger-list-for-the-estonia-ferry-disaster)

For the final project I will be analizing the data from "The Estonia Disaster". The estonia disaster it's similar to the Titanic but with different survivors.
I have become familria with everything that happend before the incident therefore I know what the survivor charts should look like based on that information.
The data that I have aviable it's only the names of the people and the age and sex. I'll be looking at every single person but I will eleminate the names last names
and the nationality.
